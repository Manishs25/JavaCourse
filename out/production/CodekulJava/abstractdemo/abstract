Abstraction
- process of hiding the internal implementation details from the user & provides the user
with necessary information

2 ways to achieve abstraction
1. Abstract class(0-100%)
2. Interface(100%)

Abstract class
- stores the data members & methods

//Syntax
abstract class class_name{
	int pid;
	String name;
	abstract void show();
}
Rules:
1. an abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword
2. can have abstract & non-abstract method(concrete method)
3. cannot be instantiated
4. can have constructors & static methods
5. can have final methods

Notes:
1. if class contains abstract method in that case class must be abstract
2. if class is abstract then it may or may not be contains abstract method


Homework
1. public abstract class Bank {
       abstract float getRateOfInterest();
   }
   class SBI extends Bank{}
   class HDFC extends Bank{}
   class ICICI extends Bank{}
